# Image Classification using CNN

This project implements an Image Classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained to classify images into different categories with high accuracy by leveraging deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview

- Build and train a CNN model for image classification tasks.
- Use popular deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch).
- Preprocess image datasets for training and testing.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy and loss.
- Save and load trained models for future inference.

## Features

- Image preprocessing pipeline (resizing, normalization, augmentation).
- Custom CNN architecture tailored for the classification problem.
- Training and validation split to monitor performance.
- Model saving and loading functionality.
- Prediction on new images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow or Keras (depending on implementation)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- scikit-learn (optional, for metrics)
- OpenCV or PIL (for image processing)

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rachana1707-S/Image-Classification-using-CNN.git
   cd Image-Classification-using-CNN
   ```

2. Prepare your dataset:

Place your images in structured folders (e.g., data/train/class_name/ and data/test/class_name/).

Modify dataset paths in the training script if needed.

3. Train the model:
```bash
python train.py
```

4. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

5. Predict on new images:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image path_to_image.jpg
   ```
